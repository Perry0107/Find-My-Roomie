Featurs

1) One Can see profile photo by clicking on home screen unlike Instagram and Snapchat.
2) Both dark and light theme customisable fonts.
3) Easy to navigate as there are various subsections like status and calls.
4) Seperate button for creating new group/broadcast/chats.



Suggestions

1) If they create another section for groups like chats/status/calls.(we can see the example of discord)
2) If they can add a voice search for searching contacts and creating groups.
3) Showing archive chats option on the top is bit annoying because I don't wanna show someone that I archived chats( while accidently  sharing screen *wink wink*)
